# LeetCode_Solutions

An archive where I store all the solutions of mine for LeetCode. The aim is to contribute reference documentation and improve my skills simultaneously.

## Feature

- **Language:** C++, C#

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/LongDorat/LeetCode_Solutions`

2. Install every library ready for compile. For simple, install IDE that included all the library such as Visual Studio.

## Project Structure

- `[00001] Example Problem` Store all the solutions for every language supported of one problem.
- `Project's name.*` Main file for compile.
- `library\` library from the language itself such as `System`.
- `class\` store classes.
- `function\` store functions, methods or whatever your language defines.
- `bin\Debug\` store built console app.

## Usage

1. Open problem's folder at this directory with your IDE or navigate to it via terminal:

    `{repository address} \ LeetCode_Solutions \ [00001] Example Problem \ {language} \*`

    ***Attention:*** You don't want to open the **repository's folder** itself (`LeetCode_Solutions\*`) OR the **problems's folder** (`[00001] Example Problem\*`) because it might cause problem with compiler.

2. Build the executable under `bin\Debug` folder.
